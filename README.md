### Analysis Objectives & Features Implemented

**1. Data Transformation & Modeling:**
* Cleaned and transformed raw transactional data, creating a robust **Star Schema** with `Sales`, `Products`, `Customers`, and `Geography` tables.
* Engineered new features in Power Query, such as creating a **Discount Category** to support average discount analysis.

**2. Advanced DAX for Dynamic Analysis:**
* Developed complex DAX measures to identify the **Top/Bottom 5 Products** by Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold.
* Created a dynamic framework for **Period-wise Comparison**, allowing users to select and compare performance across different timeframes (e.g., This Month vs. Last Month).
* Calculated key metrics like `Total Revenue`, `Profit Margin %`, `Total Orders`, and `Average Discount per Category`.

**3. Time Series & Correlation Analysis:**
* Visualized **Time Series Trends** with line charts, allowing drill-down from annual to quarterly, monthly, and daily views.
* Used **scatter plots** to analyze the **Sales vs. Profit Correlation**, identifying products with high sales but low profitability.

**4. Interactive & Detailed Visualizations:**
* Designed an intuitive dashboard with a **City-wise Sales Breakdown** using maps and bar charts.
* Included an **Order-level Detail View**, allowing users to filter granularly by Product, Customer ID, Date, and Promotion Categories.
